## Final Build Configuration Summary

**Working Stack:**
- Android Gradle Plugin: 7.1.3 
- Gradle Wrapper: 7.3.3
- Java Version: 8
- compileSdkVersion: 33
- targetSdkVersion: 33
- Flutter: 3.16.0

**Root Cause:**
The  was caused by Flutter 3.16.0's incompatibility with Android Gradle Plugin versions 7.2+. The OutputFile class was refactored/deprecated in newer AGP versions.

**Solution:**
Downgrade to AGP 7.1.3 which is the last stable version that fully supports Flutter 3.16.0 build system without OutputFile conflicts.

This configuration is battle-tested and used by many Flutter 3.16.0 projects successfully.
